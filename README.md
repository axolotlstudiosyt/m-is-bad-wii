# m-is-bad-wii
A port of the infamous "M is Bad!" flash sprite cartoon by Hexis. Ported to Wii by me, Axolotl Studios. For use on NTSC-U Wiis only with system menu version 4.3U. Credits to M is Bad can be found in the flash by going to "Scene Select", then "Credits".

"M is Bad!" is a flash cartoon that involves Mario getting extremely drunk at a party in Peach's castle, doing something terrible to Luigi, then Luigi getting revenge on Mario, only for the former get accidentally killed by the latter.
Then we find out that an evil clone of Mario set this entire situation up by disguising as Mario during the party.\
